This is another my simple and small app to let's say master React :D, this time we'll have a typical list with blogs, that contain name, description, content + tags or additional info, that you can search through them. Also you can ADD/SHOW/DELETE posts - typical CRUD with REST api, based on HEROKU api = without EDIT opt.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
